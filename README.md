# TFT Stat Tracker

Riot banned augment placement stats so I'm collecting them myself

Idk why nobody has a public repository about this so here it is. If this violates some sort of policy message me to take it down please.

I'm currently scraping lolchess because I can't be bothered enough to sign up for riot api. Maybe sometime in the future if I care enough I will transition over.

This is still heavily work in progress, use at your own risk

## QuickStart

TODO: Teach people how to use it

## TODO

- [x] Add caching for augment, unit, and item id for better performance
- [ ] Add consumer / producer implementations for ETL
- [ ] Add a scheduler
- [ ] Add a status tracking for games so I don't rescrape them
- [ ] Scrape more than just the first page
- [ ] Change liscense to WTFPL
- [ ] Add a frontend to actually be able to see the stats
